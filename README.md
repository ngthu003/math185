# Math 185: Introduction to Computational Statistics

This is the collection of the assignments I am currently working on in my class Math 185 at UCSD, whose focus is on the understanding the connections between statistical theory, numerical results, and analysis of real data through hands-on projects using R.

## Homework 1

Focus: 

* **Chi-squared test** for testing Uniform distribution and Independence between variables.
* Test extensions: Monte Carlo simulation, Calibration by Permutation.

## Midterm 1

Focus:
* Investigate differences between **Student's t-test** and **Wilcoxon Signed-rank test**, including their powers in detecting alternative hypothesis.
* Test for Independence between factors, in the form of contigency table via **Chi-squared test**, including writing functions to process data given in data.frame, and plotting.

## Acknowledgments

* The Professor and TAs for clarifying the concepts and sometimes giving code examples
* Classmates for clarifying the concepts and recommending the right technique, and debugging the codes
