# Math 185: Introduction to Computational Statistics

This is the collection of the assignments I am currently working on in my class Math 185 at UCSD, whose focus is on the understanding the connections between statistical theory, numerical results, and analysis of real data through hands-on projects using R.

## Homework 1

Focus: 

* **Chi-squared test** for testing Uniform distribution and Independence between variables.
* Test extensions: Monte Carlo simulation, Calibration by Permutation

## Acknowledgments

* The Professor and TAs for clarifying the concepts and sometimes giving code examples
* Classmates for clarifying the concepts and recommending the right technique, and debugging the codes
